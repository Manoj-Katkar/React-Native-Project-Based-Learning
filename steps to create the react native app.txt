# Step 1: Install Required Software

# 1.1 Install Node.js
# Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org.
# Ensure npm (Node Package Manager) is installed as well.
# Verify installation:
node -v     # Displays Node.js version
npm -v      # Displays npm version

# 1.2 Install Java Development Kit (JDK)
# Download JDK from Oracle: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html
# Set JAVA_HOME environment variable:
# - Right-click on "This PC" > Properties > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables
# - Add a new system variable:
#    Variable name: JAVA_HOME
#    Variable value: Path to your JDK (e.g., C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-<version>)
# Add JDK bin to the system PATH:
# - Edit the "Path" variable and add: %JAVA_HOME%\bin

# 1.3 Install Android Studio
# Download and install Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio
# During installation, make sure to install the Android SDK, Android SDK Platform-Tools, and Android Emulator.
# Launch Android Studio and open SDK Manager:
# - Install the latest Android SDK (e.g., Android 12, API 31 or higher)
# - Install the Android SDK Tools and Android Emulator.

# Step 2: Set Up the Android Emulator

# 2.1 Open Android Studio
# Go to Tools > AVD Manager
# Create a new Virtual Device (e.g., Pixel 3)
# Select a system image (e.g., Android 12, API 31)
# Click "Finish" to create the emulator.

# 2.2 Start the Android Emulator
# In AVD Manager, click the play button next to the created emulator to start it.

# Step 3: Install React Native CLI and Create a New App

# 3.1 Install React Native CLI globally (optional):
npm install -g react-native-cli  # Installs React Native CLI

# 3.2 Create a new React Native app:
npx @react-native-community/cli init "MyNewApp" 
   # Replace "MyNewApp" with your app name
#3.3 go to the project directory and create the local.properties file under the android 
C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\React-Native-Project-learning\ProjectName\android

local.properties = sdk.dir=C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk


# Step 4: Run the React Native App on Android Emulator

# 4.1 Start Metro Bundler (the development server for React Native): (used to run the app in the browser )
npx react-native start

# 4.2 Open a new terminal window and run the app on the Android emulator:
npx react-native run-android

shortcut to create the react native component : rnfe

# Step 5: Troubleshooting

# If the app doesn't run, ensure:
# - Android Studio and SDK are properly set up
# - AVD (Android Virtual Device) is running
# - SDK path is correctly set in local.properties (or as ANDROID_HOME in environment variables):
#    sdk.dir=C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk

# Run this command to check for common setup issues:
npx react-native doctor
